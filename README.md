# Capture the Flag

This is a fun security challenge for beginner programmers. It requires little knowledge beyond basic developer tools.

To run it, you can simply
~~~
npm install
npm run start
~~~

and access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). It may be beneficial to use [`ngrok`](https://ngrok.io) to
